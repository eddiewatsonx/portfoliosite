      <h2>Hello.</h2>
      <p class="intro">I am a generalist of sorts and believe that it is important to diversify
        your spectrum of knowledge, skills, and your career.
        I have my Bachelor's in Business Adminstration with a concentration in
        Entrepreneurship and Small Businesses, expereince and a resume of different
        video, photo, and editing projects, an investor and property manager
        in the real estate market, investor in the stock market and currently on
        my way to becoming a full-stack web developer. I love caffiene, hiking,
        gaming, and views from wherever I am in the world at the time, all while
        learning new coding languages, building websites, or messing/building tech.</p>

        <h3>Design and Development</h3>
        <p>Since a kid I've always had a fascination with how things appear and
          tech and one of the most influential and impactful ways to incorporate this
          fascination of the two was to learn how tech and computers work. I began my web
          development journey about a decade ago and have dug deeper and deeper into the
          world of front-end web development in hopes to create impact and inspirational
          websites, applications, and digital products or services for individuals and companies
          to help spread their product or service for the world to see.</p>

        <h3>Traveling</h3>
        <p>Now you may not think of traveling as a skill but I believe it's one of the most
          technical, analytical, and creative skills to develop and improve on all while learning in the
          process of doing so. From planning logistics to getting to and from places, learning and embracing different cultures you get immersed
          in, and sharing or teaching a travel companion or people back home about where you're visting or have visited, takes
          a lot of time and skill to develop. Traveling is one of the best teachers in my opinion as well. I've traveled to many countries and places
          here in the states and plan on traveling and learning more about different corners of the world to incorporate
          different perspectives, knowledge, and skill in my own life.</p>
